# Sales Prediction Dashboard 📊

This project is a machine learning application that predicts future sales based on price, discount, and month. It allows users to compare different algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

**Deployed App:** [https://salespredictionmodelpsf.streamlit.app](https://salespredictionmodelpsf.streamlit.app)

## 📂 Project Structure
* `app.py`: The main Streamlit dashboard application.
* `prediction_model.py`: Contains the logic for training and predicting with Linear, Random Forest, and LSTM models.
* `generate_data.py`: Script used to generate the synthetic training dataset.
* `sales_dataset.csv`: The historical sales data used for training.
